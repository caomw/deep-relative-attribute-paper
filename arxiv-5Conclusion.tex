\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec.5}

In this paper, we introduced an approach for learning to rank images, based on relative attributes. Unlike the previous methods, that use engineered or hand-crafted features, our proposed method learns attribute-specific features, on-the-fly, in the process of learning the ranking function. One important and novel feature of the proposed framework is that we can deal with the equality relation between images in terms of each specific attribute, and learn the model accordingly. The results indicate that the learned features could better characterize the attributes, and, thus, leading to better ranking accuracies, on both coarse-grained or fine-grained datasets.
