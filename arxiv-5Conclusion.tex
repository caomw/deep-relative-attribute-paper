\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec.5}

In this paper, we introduced an approach for relative attribute prediction on images, based on a convolutional neural network. Unlike previous methods that use engineered or hand-crafted features, our proposed method learns attribute-specific features, on-the-fly, during the learning procedure of the ranking function. Our results achieve state-of-the-art performance in relative attribute prediction on various datasets both coarse- and fine-grained.
We qualitatively show that the feature learning and extraction part, effectively learns appropriate features for each attribute and dataset.
Furthermore, we show that one can use a trained model for relative attribute prediction to obtain saliency maps for each attribute in the image.
