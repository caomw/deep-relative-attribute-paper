%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
Visual attributes are great means of describing images or scenes, in a way both humans and computers understand. In order to establish a correspondence between images and to be able to compare the strength of each property between images, relative attributes were introduced. However, ever since their introduction, hand-crafted and engineered features were used to learn complex models for the attributes. This limits the applicability of those methods for more realistic cases. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network strategy to rank images, based on a set of learned attribute-specific features. A convolutional neural network (ConvNet) architecture is adopted to learn the features and an additional layer (ranking layer) learns to rank the images, based on these features. Therefore, our proposed model enjoys a unified deep neural network model, in which both feature learning and ranking are intertwined, influencing each other while enhancing the overall performance. We use all publicly-available fine-grained and coarse-grained relative attribute datasets, and evaluate our method. Our proposed method outperforms the baseline and state-of-the-art methods, which shows that the learned features can better characterize the attributes.
