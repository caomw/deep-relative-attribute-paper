\section{Introduction}

 After the "Relative Attributes" paper \cite{parikh2011}, there was a stream of papers that aimed to solve the same or similar task (\cite{Li2013,Yu2014,Sandeep_2014_CVPR,Lee_2013_7540}) using a different and often more complex model instead of the original RankSVM model. I think as progress in the "Visual Recognition" field has shown, for solving the problem you actually need to change the features not the model. So in this project I actually want to experiment with how learning the features end-to-end (or fine-tuning the features) can improve Relative Attributes accuracy and power.
